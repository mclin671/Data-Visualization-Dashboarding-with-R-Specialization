# Data-Visualization-Dashboarding-with-R-Specialization
Data Visualization &amp; Dashboarding with R Specialization - Johns Hopkins
Data Visualization and Dashboarding with R Specialization is a course I took online via Coursera.
The specialization consisted of 5 different courses: 
1. Getting Started with Data Visualization in R (dplyr, tidyr)
2. Data Visualization in R with ggplot2 (ggplot2)
3. Advanced Data Visualization with R (plotly, maps, gganimate, ggally, ggthemes)
4. Publishing Visualization in R with Shiny and flexdashboard (Shiny, flexdashboard)
5. Capstone final project

The files here document the assignments finished for the course as well as what I learned.
